## Abstract

SHA-3 (Secure Hash Algorithm 3) is a member of the Secure Hash Algorithm family of standards, released by NIST on August 5, 2015. This document presents a set of SHA-3 functions in SPARQL.

## Motivation

SPARQL was published in 2013. In 2015 a new set of SHA-3 functions appeared. The SHA-3 functions have several benefits:

* **Security:** SHA-3 functions provide a high level of security against various types of attacks such as pre-image, collision, and length extension attacks. 
* **Popularity:** SHA-3 functions are widely used.
* **Efficiency:** SHA-3 functions are optimized for performance and can be implemented efficiently in software. They are designed to be faster and more efficient than their predecessors, such as SHA-1 and SHA-2.
* **Standardization:** SHA-3 functions are standardized by NIST and have been extensively reviewed by the cryptographic community. 
* **Future-proofing:** SHA-3 functions were designed with the future in mind, and they have a long projected lifespan. They are resistant to quantum computing attacks, making them an excellent choice for long-term security needs.

## Proposal

* `sha3_224` – 28 bit Digest-Size
* `sha3_256` – 32 bit Digest-Size
* `sha3_384` – 48 bit Digest-Size
* `sha3_512` – 64 bit Digest-Size
